# Python Basics

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language designed for simplicity and readability. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991** and is widely used in various fields like web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.

- ‚úî **Interpreted Language** ‚Äì Code runs line by line (no compilation required)
- ‚úî **Cross-platform** ‚Äì Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚úî **Extensive Libraries** ‚Äì NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Pytorch, etc.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why is Python So Popular?

Python is one of the most popular programming languages because of:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Readability & Simplicity**

- Its syntax is close to the English language, making it beginner-friendly.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Versatility**

- Used in **Web Development**, **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, **Automation**, **Cybersecurity**, and more.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Large Community Support**

- Python has a huge developer community and many open-source libraries.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Strong Libraries & Frameworks**

- **Django**, **Flask** (Web Development)
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** (Data Science)
- **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch** (AI/ML)

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Automation**

- Python is widely used for automating repetitive tasks.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Differences Between Python and JavaScript

| **Feature**            | **Python üêç**                                | **JavaScript üåê**                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax**             | Simple, easy to read                         | More symbols (`{}`, `;`)                                   |
| **Usage**              | AI, ML, Data Science, Backend                | Web Development (Frontend + Backend)                       |
| **Execution**          | Runs on a server or locally                  | Runs mainly in browsers (but also on servers with Node.js) |
| **Typing**             | Dynamically Typed (No need to declare types) | Also Dynamically Typed but has `var`, `let`, `const`       |
| **Backend Frameworks** | Django, Flask, FastAPI                       | Node.js, Express.js                                        |
| **Frontend Usage**     | Not used for frontend                        | Mainly used for frontend (React, Vue, Angular)             |

## üî• When to Use Python vs JavaScript?

- **Use Python** for Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, and Backend Development.
- **Use JavaScript** for Frontend Development, Web Applications, and Full-stack projects.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ How Python Code is Executed? (Interpreted vs Compiled Languages)

---

## üîπ **Compiled Languages** (C, C++, Java, etc.)

- The entire code is converted into **machine code** before execution.
- Needs a separate compiler (e.g., `gcc` for C, `javac` for Java).
- **Faster execution** but requires compilation every time the code changes.

---

## üîπ **Interpreted Languages** (Python, JavaScript, PHP, etc.)

- Code is executed **line by line** by an interpreter (e.g., `python` for Python).
- No need for compilation ‚Äì easier to debug but **slightly slower** than compiled languages.

üí° Python is an interpreted language because it runs code line by line using the Python interpreter

# Python Data Types

Python provides a variety of built-in data types that allow developers to work with different kinds of data. Below is an overview of the main data types in Python:

## **Numeric Types**

1. **int**: Represents integers (e.g., `1`, `42`, `-10`).
2. **float**: Represents floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`).
3. **complex**: Represents complex numbers (e.g., `1+2j`, `-3+4j`).

## **Sequence Types**

1. **list**: An ordered, mutable collection of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
2. **tuple**: An ordered, immutable collection of items (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`).
3. **range**: Represents a sequence of numbers (e.g., `range(0, 10)`).

## **Text Type**

1. **str**: Represents text (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).

## **Set Types**

1. **set**: An unordered collection of unique items (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`).
2. **frozenset**: An immutable version of a set.

## **Mapping Type**

1. **dict**: A collection of key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`).

## **Boolean Type**

1. **bool**: Represents truth values (`True` or `False`).

## **Binary Types**

1. **bytes**: Immutable sequence of bytes (e.g., `b"hello"`).
2. **bytearray**: Mutable sequence of bytes.
3. **memoryview**: Provides memory access to byte data without copying.

## **None Type**

1. **NoneType**: Represents the absence of a value (`None`).
